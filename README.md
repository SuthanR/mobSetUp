Protractor and Cucumber overview

Protractor

Protractor is an end-to-end test framework for Angular and AngularJS applications. Protractor runs tests against
your application running in a real browser, interacting with it as a user would.

Cucumber

Cucumber is a framework for writing high-level specifications of an application's functionality using plain text.
It can be written and understood by non-technical people involved in a project. Cucumber’s language, Gherkin,
lets you describe software’s behaviour without detailing implementation details.
